        Anatomy of a CSS ruleset

        the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand how it works :

    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/css-declaration-small.png" alt="CSS structure" width=500px>
    <p>
        The structure above is called a <strong class="underline">"Ruleset"</strong>
    </p>
    <h3>
        NAMES OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTS
    </h3>
    <p>
        <strong id="heading">Selector</strong>
    </p>
        <div>
            This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, <p> elements). To style a different element, change the selector.
        </div>
            <p>
                <strong id="heading">Declaration</strong>
            </p>
            <div>
                This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.
            </div>
            <p>
                <strong id="heading">Properties</strong>
            </p>
            <div class="grey">
                These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the "p" elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.
            </div>
                <p>
                    <strong id="heading">Property value</strong>
                </p>
                <div>
                    To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)
                </div>
                <div>Note the other important parts of the syntax:</div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})</li>
                        <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.
                        </li>
                        <li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <h2>
                    Selecting multiple elements
                </h2>
                <div>
                    can also select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset to all of them. Separate multiple selectors by commas.
                </div>
                <h2>
                    Different types of selectors
                </h2>
                <div  class="grey">
                    There are many different types of selectors. The examples above use element selectors, which select all elements of a given type. But we can make more specific selections as well.
